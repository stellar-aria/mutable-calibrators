# Mutable Calibrators

Scripts and associated utility classes for automating calibrating various Mutable Instruments Modules including Marbles and Stages (more to come as I build them or are contributed).

THESE ARE CURRENTLY NOT ACTUALLY WORKING. I have to debug and fix them at some point.

## Requirements:
- Python: ^3.12
- pyserial: `pip install pyserial`
